# Welcome to foobar Android App! üì±

Foobar Android App is the latest and most advanced social network application! In this version, we have created the layout for the sign-up page, sign-in page, and the post feed.

Registration is mandatory to access the application. Users must fill in all fields during registration, and the password must meet specific criteria: it should contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and be at least 8 characters long. Additionally, users are required to upload a profile image.

This project implements a RESTful API using NodeJS, designed to interface with both an Android application and a React web application. It uses MongoDB for data persistence and supports user authentication via JWT.

### Server Setup:

- **Technology Stack** : NodeJS, Express, MongoDB
- **Security** : JWT for authentication
- **API Base URL** : [local](http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/)

## Authentication
### User Registration
- `POST /api/users` - Registers a new user with username, password, display name, and profile picture.
### User Login
- `POST /api/tokens` - Logs in a user and returns a JWT.

## API Endpoints
### Users
- **Create User**: `POST /api/users`
- **Get User Details**: `GET /api/users/:id`
- **Update User Details**: `PUT /PATCH /api/users/:id`
- **Delete User**: `DELETE /api/users/:id`

### Posts
- **Fetch Posts**: `GET /api/posts` - Returns the latest 20 posts of friends and 5 latest posts of non-friends.
- **Create Post**: `POST /api/users/:id/posts`
- **Update Post**: `PUT /PATCH /api/users/:id/posts/:pid`
- **Delete Post**: `DELETE /api/users/:id/posts/:pid`

### Friends
- **Get Friends List**: `GET /api/users/:id/friends`
- **Add Friend**: `POST /api/users/:id/friends`
- **Confirm Friend Request**: `PATCH /api/users/:id/friends/:fid`
- **Delete Friend**: `DELETE /api/users/:id/friends/:fid`

## Error Handling
Responses from the server will include appropriate status codes:
- `200 OK` - Request successful.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource was not found.
- `409 Conflict` - Registration attempt with an existing username.

### Features:

- **Sign-Up Page** üìù: Allows users to register for a new account by filling out a registration form.

- **Sign-In Page** üîê: Provides users with a form to sign in to their accounts.

- **Post Feed** üì∞: Displays a dynamic feed with a list of 10 posts and images loaded from a local JSON file. Users can upload posts, comment on posts, and manage their own content by editing or deleting posts and comments.

  - Each post has options to like, comment, and share.
  
  - Clicking on the "Write a comment" button reveals all comments for that post.
  
  - The settings button on each post allows users to delete or edit their posts.
